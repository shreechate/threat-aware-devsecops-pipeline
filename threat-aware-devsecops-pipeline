threat-aware-devsecops-pipeline

This project integrates Deepfence ThreatMapper into a DevSecOps pipeline to automate security from CI/CD build to runtime. Jenkins and Docker scan container images for CVEs, misconfigs, secrets, and malware, halting builds if risk thresholds are exceeded—enforcing shift-left security.

After deployment, lightweight sensors monitor workloads on Kubernetes, Docker, and VMs. They detect live threats and vulnerabilities, while telemetry (e.g., processes and network flows) fuels a Threat Graph to map attack paths and prioritize fixes.

 Key Features:
• Jenkins-based CI/CD scanning
• CVE, secret, malware detection
• SBOM generation
• Runtime monitoring
• Threat Graph visualization
• Kubernetes, Docker, VM support
